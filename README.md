SPAI Hackathon

We collected and scrapped datasets on public wastes and tested them on our machine learning models to observe the trend of the public wastes over the years and also to distinguish between different materials like plastic,paper,aluminium,glass and so on etc.. 


This project contains the Webpage of our product and garbage classification code/models.


Tha amount of garbage and litter have been increasing exponentially over the years, yet the amount of garbage recycled still does not catch up to the amount of garbage littered,hence hopefully this project can help to promote and increase the amount of waste recycled.
